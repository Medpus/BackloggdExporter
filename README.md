# Backloggd Scraper

This Python script scrapes titles and game ratings from a [Backloggd](https://backloggd.com/) userâ€™s profile and saves them into a CSV file.  
It uses [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) to fetch the HTML pages, [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) to parse the HTML, and writes the output to a CSV file.
